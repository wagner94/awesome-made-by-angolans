## Contributing

(the same measurement rule as [awesome-made-by-russians ](https://github.com/gaearon/awesome-made-by-russians))

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add a project to this list, please make sure that:

- The project was created by developers born in Angola
- The project can't be just a personal, experimental or sample project
- The project has more than **100 stars** on Github
- Place them in alphabetical order
- If they meet the requirements above, feel free to create a PR!

## Thanks
- [ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º awesome-made-by-russians](https://github.com/gaearon/awesome-made-by-russians) For days I was thinking about the idea of bringing together Angolan communities, open source projects, startups, universities and so on, so I thought about making it real. I was inspired by Brazilian and Russian templates.
